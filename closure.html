    <h1>Closure</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript has a lexcial scope environment. If a function needs to access
      a variable, it first goes to its local memory. When it does not find it
      there, it goes to the memory of its lexical parent. See Below code, Over
      here function y along with its lexical scope i.e. (function x) would be
      called a closure.

      Advantages of Closure: Module Design Pattern Currying Memoize Data hiding
      and encapsulation setTimeouts etc. Disadvantages of Closure: Over

      simple words
      <span>
        A closure is a function that has access to its outer function scope even
        after the function has returned. Meaning, A closure can remember and
        access variables and arguments reference of its outer function even
        after the function has returned.

  }
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a, "output");
    }
    return y;
  }
  var z = x();
  console.log(z()); // value of z is entire code of function y.

  //In above code, When y is returned, not only is the function returned but the
  //  entire closure (fun y + its lexical scope) is returned and put inside z.
  //  So when z is used somewhere else in program, it still remembers var a inside x()

  //   function Welcome(name) {
  //   var greetingInfo = function (message) {
  //     console.log(message + " " + name);
  //   };
  //   return greetingInfo;
  // }
  // var myFunction = Welcome("Ashu");
  // myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
  // myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
